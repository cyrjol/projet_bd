# Streamlit-Water-Leak-Anomaly-detection
This multi-page app is a demo of our skills applied to a usecase of predicting leaks in a water system distribution.

DEPLOYMENT
The files corresponding to the application are all in the streamlit app repository.
The program "app.py", allows to launch the application, "multiapp.py" allows to have several pages which are described in the apps folder.
Yet the app needs to be linked to a private github repository (with the same files) and will update in real time to this streamlit cloud app : https://cyrjol-projet-bd-app-lqm0sl.streamlitapp.com/
